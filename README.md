# Energy Consumption Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze historical energy consumption data and build predictive models to forecast future usage, aiding in sustainable energy decision-making.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends, seasonality, and key patterns.
3. **Modeling:** Implemented and compared Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
4. **Evaluation:** Used MAE and RMSE to evaluate model performance.

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved an RMSE of X, effectively capturing the seasonal trends in the data.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Energy-Consumption-Prediction.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
